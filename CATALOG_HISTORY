0.1.0 (26 Apr 2019): Initial catalog

0.1.1 (9 May 2019): Fixed a problem with unintended newlines being printing in tsv files.

0.1.2 (25 Jun 2019): Fixed a problem with the coordinates for the Taylor 2009 catalog.

0.1.3 (17 Jul 2019): Changed/added several columns for the new CGPS catalog, to match the descriptions given in the paper.

0.1.4 (22 Jul 2019): Found and fixed a mistake in the flux units for the new CGPS catalog, changed to conform to standard.

0.1.5 (29 Nov 2019): Large update of metadata to many catalogs added in 0.1.0. Metadata was taken from the text of the papers,
       where values could be easily found.

0.1.6 (28 Jan 2020): Added the Shannahan+2019 'THOR' RMs.

0.1.7 (10 Apr 2020): Removed new CGPS (not published yet). 
    Removed 'Oppermann-sourced' RMs: some were duplicates of other catalogs I processed, some were missing sources for unknown reasons.
    Corrected Vernstrom 2018 catalog; some declinations were computed wrongly.
    Added Gaensler 2001 RMs.
    Added Clarke 2001 RMs; these were not available from the paper, but were supplied by Tracy Clarke. Note these are NOT the Galactic-subtracted RMs, and are NOT the cluster-dispersion added errors.
    Added Ma 2019 RMs; RMTable was supplied directly by Jackie Ma.

0.1.8 (11 Sep 2020): Added rmsf_fwhm column; updated RMTable version number to 1.1. All catalogs updated to V1.1 (setting rmwf_fwhm to NaN).
    Fixed problems reported with some sources have declinations of exactly 0: this was a bug in how some machine readable tables were being processed.
        Affected catalogs: Taylor 2009, Van Eck 2011, Law 2011, Kim 2016
    Added Ma 2020 RMs; RMTable was supplied directly by Jackie Ma, and modified only by updating to V1.1 and updating catalog and data_ref bibcodes.
    Added POGS-II RMs (Riseley 2020); RMTable was supplied by Chris Riseley and modified only minimally (merging pulsar and EGS tables together, converting some extra columns to flag columns, updating to V1.1).

0.1.9 (?): Small updates forgotten in the 0.1.8 changes:
    Fixed catalog for POGS-II (Riseley 2020) to be bibcode.
    Fixed fracpol column in old CGPS RMs (Brown 2003) and SGPS (Brown 2007), was in percent now in fraction.
    Added rmsf_fwhm values from paper texts, for: 2009ApJ...707..114F, 2012ApJ...755...21M, 2015ApJ...815...49A, 2018A&A...613A..58V, 2018PASA...35...43R, 2019ApJ...871..215B, 2019ApJ...887L...7S, 2020MNRAS.497.3097M, 2020PASA...37...29R
    Updated SPASS-ATCA catalog (2019MNRAS.485.1293S): fixed incorrect reference frequencies, added spectral index errors, added 2nd fitted components to catalog (3rd components were not in table, so still ignored), added position errors (adding RA/Dec errors into quadrature)
    Converted master catalog to table version 1.2
